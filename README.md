# ZawBuilder

 This modular React web application lets you build a weapon called _Zaw_ from the game Warframe by selecting the respective pieces after which the web app will calculate the final numbers.
 This project uses data from [Warframe's wiki](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Zaw) to display and calculate numbers that should reflect the in-game ones.
