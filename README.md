# [ZawBuilder ‚öîÔ∏è](kakalanp.github.io/zaw-builder/)

 This modular React [web application](kakalanp.github.io/zaw-builder/) lets you build a weapon called _Zaw_ from the game Warframe by selecting the respective pieces after which the web app will calculate the final numbers.
 This project uses data from [Warframe's wiki](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Zaw) to display and calculate numbers that should reflect the in-game ones.

## Quick tutorial: :wink:

With [ZawBuilder](kakalanp.github.io/zaw-builder/), you can do the following:

- ### Create a Zaw:
  - Open [ZawBuilder](kakalanp.github.io/zaw-builder/) and start by selecting a section of your weapon (Strike, Grip, or Link)
  - A new menu will appear, here you can select a piece that can fit into the selected slot. There are many options in each category so take your time!
  - If one looks appealing to you, make sure to click it so it turns around and shows you its stats (Pro tip: you can turn more than one at a time)
  - Click your selected piece again to select it, you'll return to the main menu with your selected piece for the slot and are now able to select the other two.
- ### ~~Share your Zaw~~
  - ~~If you have a complete build and want to share your combination with a friend, click the top-right button to copy the link to it!~~
  - ~~Now you can paste a link to your Zaw anywhere, it is that simple!~~
- ### Modify a Zaw:
  - If you didn't like the final result of your Zaw, you can always click on a piece to swap it with another one!
  - This time, in the piece selection screen, you should be able to see your current Zaw stats at the right.
  - ~~If you click on a piece now, its stats will display a ```‚ñ≤```, ```‚ñº```, or ```-```. Depending on how it compares to the piece you currently have.~~
  - Just remember that different combinations return different weapon types, so don't be surprised if your Nikana turns into a Staff!
